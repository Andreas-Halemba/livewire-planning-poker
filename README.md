```

## Services

If you want to use the mail verification feature make sure to start a mailpit

```bash
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped --name=mailpit -p 8025:8025 -p 1025:1025 axllent/mailpit
```

For the websocket server, this project uses **Laravel Reverb** - Laravel's official WebSocket server.

### Starting Reverb Locally

To start the Reverb server locally:

```bash
php artisan reverb:start --host=127.0.0.1 --port=6000
```

For better local development experience, you can run it in the background:

```bash
php artisan reverb:start --host=127.0.0.1 --port=6000 &
```

**Note:** The Reverb server must be running for real-time features like voting to work.

## Jira Integration

This application supports importing issues from Jira into your planning poker sessions.

### Configuration

Each user can configure their own Jira credentials in their profile settings:

1. Navigate to your **Profile** page
2. Scroll to the **Jira Credentials** section
3. Enter your Jira instance URL (e.g., `https://yourcompany.atlassian.net`)
4. Enter your Jira email address
5. Enter your Jira API token

**How to get your API Token:**

1. Go to [Atlassian Account Settings](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
2. Click on "API tokens"
3. Click "Create API token"
4. Give it a label (e.g., "Planning Poker")
5. Copy the generated token
6. Paste it in the profile field

**Note:** Each user needs their own API token. The token is encrypted and stored securely in the database.

**Important:** You must configure your Jira credentials before you can import issues. The Jira import section will only be visible after configuring your credentials in your profile.

### Usage

1. Configure your Jira credentials in your profile (see above)
2. As a Product Owner, navigate to your session management page
3. Enter your Jira Project Key (e.g., "SAN")
4. Select the status of tickets you want to import (e.g., "In Estimation")
5. Click "Load Tickets" to fetch all matching tickets from Jira
6. A modal will open showing all available tickets
7. Select the tickets you want to import using the checkboxes
8. Use "Select All" to quickly select/deselect all tickets
9. Click "Import Selected" to import the chosen tickets
10. Tickets that were already imported will be marked and disabled

### Testing the Jira Integration

To test the Jira integration:

1. Configure your Jira credentials in your profile
2. Use the "Test Connection" button in the profile to verify your credentials
3. Create a session or navigate to an existing one
4. Look for the "Import from Jira" card
5. Enter a valid project key and status
6. Click "Load Tickets" - you should see a modal with tickets
7. Select some tickets and import them
8. Verify that the tickets appear in your session's issue list

**Note:** Make sure your Jira instance is accessible and you have permission to view the tickets in the specified project and status.

**If you don't see the Jira import section:** Navigate to your profile settings and configure your Jira credentials first. You'll see a link in the import section that takes you directly to the profile settings.

### Production Deployment

**For production deployment**, see [WEBSOCKET.md](WEBSOCKET.md) for detailed instructions using:

- **Supervisor** (recommended for Linux servers)
- **PM2** (Node.js process manager)
- **systemd** (system service manager)

### Testing the Connection

After starting the Reverb server, open your browser console and check for WebSocket connection errors. The connection should be established to `ws://127.0.0.1:6000`.
